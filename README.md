###Arduino ESP8266 Library (Ard_esp_lib)

A basic library for development of Neuron Tech (https://hackaday.io/projects/hacker/31514) projects using Arduino and ESP8266 WiFi Module  
  
Currently the Arduino Uno/Mega is used to do all the processing however we do intend to examine the possibility of using the ESP's on-board microcontroller to replace the arduino for simple applications...  

In one of the planned application, several ESP modules incorporating various sensors will collect real time security information and forward this information via WiFi to a web server (local or remote)...  

**The proposed Web Server**  
* User editable pages...
* Database backbend for storing real time information...
* Graphical representation of you home (a floor plan using simple images)...
* Position and status of each ESP modules (on/off, battery condition etc)...
* Remote control of each ESP device via the web page (PC/Mobile)...
* Signaling via messaging or text to mobile...  

Under construction...
